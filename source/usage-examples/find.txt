=======================
Find Multiple Documents
=======================

You can query for multiple documents in a collection by calling the ``find()``
method on a ``Collection`` instance. 

Pass a query filter to the ``find()`` method to query for and return documents
that match the filter in the collection. If you do not include a filter, MongoDB
returns all the documents in the collection.

The ``find()`` method returns a ``Cursor`` type, which you can iterate through
to retrieve the documents that match the filter criteria. The {+driver-short+}
offers two access patterns to iterate through the returned ``Cursor`` instance.
For more information on iterating through documents returned by a Cursor, see
:ref:`rust-cursor-guide`.

Example
-------

This example accesses the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database and queries for restaurants that offer French cuisine. The example uses
a ``Restaurant`` struct as a model for documents in the ``restaurants`` collection.

The following code uses a query filter to match documents with a ``cuisine`` value
of ``French``, passes the filter to the ``find()`` method, and prints the matching
documents:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: find-async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/find-async.rs
         :language: rust
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: find-sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/find-sync.rs
         :language: rust
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

Expected Result 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running either of the preceding full examples prints a series of documents in the
following format:

.. code-block:: none

    // Results truncated
    ...
    Restaurant {
        address: Address {
            coord: [
                -73.92581,
                40.7032485,
            ],
            street: "Knickerbocker Avenue",
            zipcode: "11237",
        },
        borough: "Brooklyn",
        cuisine: "French",
        name: "Mominette",
    }
    ...
