=======================
Find Multiple Documents
=======================

You can query for multiple documents in a collection by calling the ``find()``
method on a ``Collection`` instance. 

Pass a query filter to the ``find()`` method to query for and return documents
that match the filter in the collection. If you do not include a filter, MongoDB
returns all the documents in the collection.

The ``find()`` method returns a ``Cursor`` type, which you can iterate through
to retrieve the documents that match the filter criteria. The {+driver-short+}
offers two access patterns to iterate through the returned ``Cursor`` instance.
For more information on iterating through documents returned by a Cursor, see
:ref:`rust-cursor-guide`.

Example
-------

This example finds documents from the ``restaurants`` collection that represent French
restaurants. It uses the following parameters:

- A query filter that instructs the driver to return only documents with a ``cuisine``
  value of ``French``
- An options parameter that sorts the matching documents in alphabetical order
