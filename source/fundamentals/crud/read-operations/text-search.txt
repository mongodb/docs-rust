Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to run a text search.
A text search allows you to efficiently query fields with string values.

.. important::

   MongoDB text search differs from the more powerful Atlas Search
   feature. To learn more, see the :atlas:`Atlas Search documentation
   </atlas-search/>`.

Sample Data for Examples
------------------------

The examples in this guide use the following ``Dish`` struct as a model
for documents in the ``menu`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
   :start-after: start-dish-struct
   :end-before: end-dish-struct
   :language: rust
   :dedent:

The examples use the following sample documents that describe
dishes you can order at a restaurant:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "name": "Shepherd’s Pie", "description": "A vegetarian take on the classic dish that uses lentils as a base. Serves 2." },
   { "name": "Green Curry", "description": "A flavorful Thai curry, made vegetarian with tofu. Vegetarian and vegan friendly." },
   { "name": "Herbed Branzino", "description": "Grilled whole fish stuffed with herbs and pomegranate seeds. Serves 3-4." },
   { "name": "Kale Tabbouleh", "description": "A bright, herb-based salad. A perfect starter for vegetarians and vegans." },
   { "name": "Garlic Butter Trout", "description": "Baked trout seasoned with garlic, lemon, dill, and, of course, butter. Serves 2." }

Text Index
----------

Before you perform a text search, you must create a **text index** on
the collection. A text index specifies the string or string array field
on which you can perform text searches.

The examples in this guide perform text searches on the
``description`` field of documents in the ``menu`` collection. To enable
text searches on the ``description`` field, create a text index as shown
in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx

Text Search
-----------

A text search retrieves documents that contain a **term** or a
**phrase** in value of the indexed field. A term is a sequence of
characters that excludes whitespace characters. A phrase is a sequence
of terms with any number of whitespace characters.

To perform a text search, include the ``$text`` evaluation query operator,
followed by the ``$search`` field in your query filter. The ``$text`` operator
specifies that you are performing a text search on the text-indexed
fields. The ``$search`` field specifies the text to search in the text-indexed fields.

Query filters for text searches use the following format:

.. code-block:: rust

   let filter = doc! { "$text": { "$search": "<search term or phrase>" } };

.. _rust-text-term:

Search for a Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for a term, specify the term as a string in your query filter.
To search for multiple terms, separate the terms with spaces.

.. note::

   When searching for multiple terms, the ``find()`` method returns
   documents with at least one of the terms in text-indexed fields.

Example
```````

The following example performs a search for documents in which the
``description`` field contains the term ``"herb"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
      :start-after: begin-by-term
      :end-before: end-by-term
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Dish { name: "Kale Tabbouleh", description: "A bright, herb-based salad. A perfect starter for vegetarians and vegans." }
      Dish { name: "Herbed Branzino", description: "Grilled whole fish stuffed with herbs and pomegranate seeds. Serves 3-4." }

.. tip::

   Even though the search term is ``"herb"``, the text search also matches
   documents in which the ``description`` field contains ``"herbs"``.
   This is because a MongoDB text index uses suffix stemming to match
   similar words. To learn more about how MongoDB matches terms, see
   :manual:`Index Entries </core/index-text/#index-entries>` in the
   Server manual.

.. _rust-text-phrase:

Search for a Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To search for a phrase, specify the phrase with escaped quotes in your
query filter:

.. code-block:: rust

   let filter = doc! { "$text": { "$search": "\"<some phrase>\"" } };

If you don't add escaped quotes around the phrase, the
search performs a :ref:`term search <rust-text-term>`.

Example
```````

The following example performs a search for documents in which the
``description`` field contains the phrase ``"serves 2"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
      :start-after: begin-by-phrase
      :end-before: end-by-phrase
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Dish { name: "Shepherd’s Pie", description: "A vegetarian take on the classic dish that uses lentils as a base. Serves 2." }
      Dish { name: "Garlic Butter Trout", description: "Baked trout seasoned with garlic, lemon, dill, and, of course, butter. Serves 2." }

Exclude Terms from Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a term or phrase you want to exclude from your text search,
prefix it with a minus sign in your query filter:

.. code-block:: rust

   let filter = doc! { "$text": { "$search": "<term> -<excluded term>" } };

.. important::

   You must search for at least one term or phrase to exclude
   other terms from your search. If you only exclude terms, the
   search doesn't return any documents.

Example
```````

The following example performs a search for documents in which the
``description`` field contains the term ``"vegan"``, but does not
contain the term ``"tofu"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
      :start-after: begin-exclude-term
      :end-before: end-exclude-term
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Dish { name: "Kale Tabbouleh", description: "A bright, herb-based salad. A perfect starter for vegetarians and vegans." }

Sort by Relevance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A text search assigns a numerical text score to indicate how closely
each result matches the string in your query filter. To reveal the text
score in your output, use a projection to retrieve the ``textScore``
field from the metadata. You can sort the text score in descending order
by specifying a sort on the ``textScore`` metadata field.

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

- Performs a search for documents in which the ``description`` field contains the term ``"vegetarian"``
- Sorts the results in descending order on text score
- Includes only the ``name`` and ``score`` fields in the output

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
      :start-after: begin-sort-relevance
      :end-before: end-sort-relevance
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Document({"name": String("Green Curry"), "score": Double(0.9166666666666667)})
      Document({"name": String("Kale Tabbouleh"), "score": Double(0.5625)})
      Document({"name": String("Shepherd’s Pie"), "score": Double(0.5555555555555556)})

.. _rust-search-text-aggregation:

Aggregation
-----------

You can include the ``$text`` evaluation query operator in a
:manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` aggregation
stage to perform a text search in an aggregation pipeline.

The following sections demonstrate how to perform text searches by using
aggregation pipelines instead of by using the ``find()`` method.

Match a Search Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses an aggregation to perform a search for
documents in which the ``description`` field contains the term
``"herb"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
      :start-after: begin-agg-term
      :end-before: end-agg-term
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("Kale Tabbouleh"), "description": String("A bright, herb-based salad. A perfect starter for vegetarians and vegans.")})
      Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("Herbed Branzino"), "description": String("Grilled whole fish stuffed with herbs and pomegranate seeds. Serves 3-4.")})

Sort by Relevance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses an aggregation to perform the following actions:

- Performs a search for documents in which the ``description`` field contains the term ``"vegetarian"``
- Sorts the results in descending order on text score
- Includes only the ``name`` and ``score`` fields in the output

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/text.rs
      :start-after: begin-agg-relevance
      :end-before: end-agg-relevance
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Document({"name": String("Green Curry"), "score": Double(0.9166666666666667)})
      Document({"name": String("Kale Tabbouleh"), "score": Double(0.5625)})
      Document({"name": String("Shepherd’s Pie"), "score": Double(0.5555555555555556)})
