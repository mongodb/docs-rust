Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to access data with a **cursor**.

A cursor is a mechanism that allows an application to iterate over
database results while holding only a subset of them in memory at a
given time. Read operations that match multiple documents use a cursor
to return those documents in batches as opposed to all at once.

.. tip::

   Batch size of the cursor can be configured using the options of the
   method that returns it. For example, setting the batch_size field of
   ``FindOptions`` will set the batch size of the cursor returned by
   ``Collection::find``. For more information, see `Cursor
   <{+api+}/struct.Cursor.html>`__ in the API documentation.

Sample Cursor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each section uses the following ``cursor`` variable, which is a
``Cursor`` struct that contains all the documents in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor def
   :end-before: end cursor def

.. tip::

   For more information of the ``find()`` method, see
   :ref:`rust-retrieve-guide`.


.. _rust-individual-documents:

Retrieve Documents Individually
-------------------------------

To retrieve documents from your cursor individually, use the
``next()`` method in the ``futures::stream::StreamExt`` crate:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-cursor-next
   :end-before: end-cursor-next

To attempt retrieving documents from your cursor individually, use the
``try_next()`` method in the ``futures::stream::TryStreamExt`` crate:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin try next
   :end-before: end try next

.. _rust-all-documents:

Retrieve All Documents
----------------------

To populate an array with all of your query results, use the ``collect()``
method in the ``futures::stream::StreamExt`` crate:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor collect
   :end-before: end cursor collect

To attempt to populate an array with all of your query results, use the
``try_collect()`` method in the ``futures::stream::TryStreamExt`` crate:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin try collect
   :end-before: end try collect

Additional Information
----------------------

A cursor in the {+driver-short+} will automatically be closed via an
asynchronous ``killCursors`` command if the cursor is still open
when it goes out of scope.
