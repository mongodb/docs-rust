Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **bulk operations**.

Bulk operations perform multiple write operations against one or more
namespaces. Instead of making a call to the database for each operation,
bulk operations perform multiple operations with one database call.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`bulk-sample-data`
- :ref:`bulk-operation-types`
- :ref:`bulk-modify-behavior`
- :ref:`bulk-mixed-namespaces`
- :ref:`bulk-addtl-info`

.. important::

  To perform bulk write operations, ensure that your application meets the
  following requirements:

  - You are connected to MongoDB Server version 8.0 or later.
  - You are using {+driver-short+} version 3.0 or later.

.. _bulk-sample-data:

Sample Data
-----------

The examples in this guide use the following sample documents, which
are modeled as ``Mushroom`` structs and stored in the ``db.mushrooms``
namespace:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/bulk.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-sample-data
   :end-before: end-sample-data

.. _bulk-operation-types:

Bulk Operation Types
--------------------

To perform a bulk write operation, pass an array of ``WriteModel`` struct instances to the 
``bulk_write()`` method. 

In this section, you can learn how to perform the following bulk write operations
by defining their corresponding ``WriteModel`` struct types:

- :ref:`Bulk insert operations <bulk-insert-operation>`
- :ref:`Bulk replace operations <bulk-replace-operation>`
- :ref:`Bulk update operations <bulk-update-operation>`
- :ref:`Bulk delete operations <bulk-delete-operation>`

.. tip::

  You can also perform multiple types of write operations in a single ``bulk_write()``
  method call. For an example that passes a ``DeleteOneModel`` and an ``InsertOneModel`` to
  the same ``bulk_write()`` call, see the :ref:`Modify Behavior example <bulk-opts-example>`
  on this page.

.. _bulk-insert-operation:

Insert
~~~~~~

To perform a bulk insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` instance for each document
you want to insert.

To construct an ``InsertOneModel``, specify the following struct fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``namespace`` 
     - | The namespace on which the insert is performed.
       | Type: ``Namespace``

   * - ``document`` 
     - | The document to insert.
       | Type: ``Document``

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies two ``InsertOneModel`` instances in an array. Each ``InsertOneModel`` represents
  a document to be inserted into the ``db.mushrooms`` namespace.
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulk_write()`` method.
- Prints the number of inserted documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/bulk.rs
      :start-after: begin-insert
      :end-before: end-insert
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Inserted documents: 2

.. _bulk-replace-operation:

Replace
~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk replace operation, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` instance for each document
you want to replace.

To construct a ``ReplaceOneModel``, specify the following struct fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``namespace`` 
     - | The namespace on which the operation is performed.
       | Type: ``Namespace``

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches the document you want to replace.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``replacement`` 
     - | The replacement document.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about collations,
       | see the :ref:`rust-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
       | indexes, see :manual:`Indexes </indexes/>` in the Server
       | manual.
       | Type: ``Bson``

   * - ``upsert`` 
     - | (Optional) Whether a new document is created if no document matches the filter.
       | By default, this field is set to ``false``.
       | Type: ``bool``

Example
```````
This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies two ``ReplaceOneModel`` instances in an array. The ``ReplaceOneModel`` instances
  contain instructions to replace documents representing mushrooms in the
  ``db.mushrooms`` namespace.
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulk_write()`` method.
- Prints the number of modified documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/bulk.rs
      :start-after: begin-replace
      :end-before: end-replace
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Modified documents: 2

.. _bulk-update-operation:

Update
~~~~~~

To perform a bulk update operation, create an ``UpdateOneModel`` or ``UpdateManyModel``
instance for each update you want to make. An ``UpdateOneModel`` updates only one
document that matches a filter, while an ``UpdateManyModel`` updates all documents that match
a filter.

To construct an ``UpdateOneModel`` or an ``UpdateManyModel``, specify the following struct fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``namespace`` 
     - | The namespace on which the operation is performed.
       | Type: ``Namespace``

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches one or more documents you want to update. When specified in an ``UpdateOneModel``,
       | only the first matching document will be updated. When specified in an ``UpdateManyModel``, all
       | matching documents will be updated.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``update`` 
     - | The update to perform.
       | Type: ``UpdateModifications``

   * - ``array_filters`` 
     - | (Optional) A set of filters specifying which array elements an update applies to.
       | Type: ``Array``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about collations,
       | see the :ref:`rust-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
       | indexes, see :manual:`Indexes </indexes/>` in the Server
       | manual.
       | Type: ``Bson``

   * - ``upsert`` 
     - | (Optional) Whether a new document is created if no document matches the filter.
       | By default, this field is set to ``false``.
       | Type: ``bool``

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies an ``UpdateOneModel`` and an ``UpdateManyModel`` instance in an array. These models
  contain instructions to update documents representing mushrooms in the
  ``db.mushrooms`` namespace.
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulk_write()`` method.
- Prints the number of modified documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/bulk.rs
      :start-after: begin-update
      :end-before: end-update
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Modified documents: 2

.. _bulk-delete-operation:

Delete
~~~~~~

To perform a bulk delete operation, create a ``DeleteOneModel`` or ``DeleteManyModel``
instance for each delete operation. A ``DeleteOneModel`` deletes only one document
that matches a filter, while a ``DeleteManyModel`` deletes all documents that match
a filter.

To construct a ``DeleteOneModel`` or a ``DeleteManyModel``, specify the following struct fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``namespace`` 
     - | The namespace on which the operation is performed.
       | Type: ``Namespace``

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches one or more documents you want to delete. When specified in a ``DeleteOneModel``,
       | only the first matching document will be deleted. When specified in a ``DeleteManyModel``, all
       | matching documents will be deleted.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about collations,
       | see the :ref:`rust-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
       | indexes, see :manual:`Indexes </indexes/>` in the Server
       | manual.
       | Type: ``Bson``

Example
```````
This example performs the following actions:

- Specifies a ``DeleteOneModel`` and a ``DeleteManyModel`` instance in an array. These models
  contain instructions to delete documents representing mushrooms in the
  ``db.mushrooms`` namespace.
- Passes the array of models to the ``bulk_write()`` method.
- Prints the number of deleted documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/bulk.rs
      :start-after: begin-delete
      :end-before: end-delete
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Deleted documents: 3

.. _bulk-modify-behavior:

Modify Behavior
---------------

You can modify the behavior of the ``bulk_write()`` method by setting ``BulkWriteOptions`` field
values. To set these struct fields, chain the fields' corresponding methods to the ``bulk_write()``
method.

The ``BulkWriteOptions`` struct contains the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 60 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Default Value

   * - ``ordered`` 
     - | Whether the operations run in the order in which they were specified.
       | When set to ``true``, the driver does not perform subsequent write operations if one operation fails.
       | When set to ``false``, the driver continues to attempt write operations if one fails.
       | Type: ``bool``
     - ``true``

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | Whether document-level validation is bypassed.
       | Type: ``bool``
     - ``false``

   * - ``comment``
     - | An arbitrary comment to help trace the operation through the database profiler, currentOp,
       | and logs.
       | Type: ``Bson``
     - ``None``

   * - ``let_vars``
     - | A map of parameter names and values to apply to all operations within the bulk write.
       | Values must be constant or closed expressions that do not reference document fields.
       | Type: ``Document``
     - ``None``

   * - ``write_concern``
     - | The write concern to use for this bulk operation.
       | Type: ``WriteConcern``
     - Inherits the namespace's write concern

.. _bulk-opts-example:

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example sets the ``ordered`` field to ``false`` by chaining the ``ordered()`` method
to the ``bulk_write()`` method: 

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/bulk.rs
      :start-after: begin-options
      :end-before: end-options
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Inserted documents: 1
      Deleted documents: 0

Since the filter specified in the ``DeleteOneModel`` does not match any documents, the code
performs only an insert operation. If you do not set the ``ordered`` field to ``false``, the bulk
operation will not attempt any subsequent operations after the unsuccessful delete and will not
insert the specified document.

.. _bulk-mixed-namespaces:

Write to Mixed Namespaces
-------------------------

The preceding examples on this page perform bulk operations on the ``db.mushrooms`` namespace. However,
you can perform bulk writes on multiple namespaces in a single method call.

The following example inserts one document into the ``db.mushrooms`` namespace and one document into
the ``people.students`` namespace:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/bulk.rs
      :start-after: begin-mixed-namespaces
      :end-before: end-mixed-namespaces
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Inserted documents: 2

.. _bulk-addtl-info:
