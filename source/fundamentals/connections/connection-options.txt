This section explains several common MongoDB connection and authentication
options. You can pass the connection options as parameters of the connection
URI to specify the behavior of the client.

   * - Option Name
     - Default Value
     - Description

   * - **appName**
     -
     - Specifies application name that the Client will send to the server as part of the handshake.
       This can be used in combination with the server logs to determine which Client is connected to a server.

   * - **authMechanism**
     -
     - Specifies which authentication mechanism to use. If not provided, one will be negotiated with the server.

   * - **authSource**
     -
     -

   * - **authMechanismProperties**
     -
     - Specifies additional properties for the given mechanism.

   * - **compressors**
     -
     - Specifies compressors that the Client is willing to use in the order they are specified in the configuration. The Client sends this list of compressors to the server. The server responds with the intersection of its supported list of compressors. The order of compressors indicates preference of compressors.

   * - ***connectTimeoutMS***
     - 10 seconds
     - Specifies the connection timeout passed to each underlying TCP stream when attempting to connect to the server.

   * - **direct**
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether the ``Client`` should directly connect to a single host rather than automatically discovering all servers in the cluster.

   * - **heartbeatFrequencyMS**
     - 10 seconds
     - Specifies amount of time each monitoring thread should wait between performing server checks.

   * - **journal**
     -
     - Requests acknowledgement that the operation has propagated to the on-disk journal.
       .. bool
       
   * - **localThresholdMS**
     - 15 milliseconds
     - When running a read operation with a ``ReadPreference`` that allows selecting secondaries,
       Specifies how much longer the average round trip time between the driver and server is allowed to be
       compared to the least round trip time of all the suitable servers.
       For example, if the average round trip times of the suitable servers are 5 milliseconds, 10 milliseconds, and 15 milliseconds,
       and the local threshold is 8 ms,
       then the first two servers are within the latency window and could be chosen for the operation, but the last one is not.
       A value of zero indicates that there is no latency window, so only the server with the lowest average round trip time is eligible.

   * - **maxIdleTimeMS**
     - 0
     - Specifies the amount of time that a connection can remain idle in a connection pool before being closed.
       A value of zero indicates that connections should not be closed due to being idle.

   * - **maxStalenessSeconds**
     -
     -

   * - **maxPoolSize**
     - 10
     - The maximum amount of connections that the ``Client`` should allow to be created in a connection pool for a given server.
       If an operation is attempted on a server while ``max_pool_size`` connections are checked out,
       the operation will block until an in-progress operation finishes and its connection returns to the pool the pool.

   * - **minPoolSize**
     - 0
     - The minimum number of connections that should be available in a serverâ€™s connection pool at a given time.
       If fewer than ``min_pool_size`` connections are in the pool, connections will be added to the pool in the background
       until ``min_pool_size`` is reached.

   * - **readConcernLevel**
     -
     -

   * - **readPreferenceField**
     -
     -

   * - **readPreferenceTags**
     -
     -

   * - **replicaSet**
     -
     - The name of the replica set that the ``Client`` should connect to.

   * - **retryReads**
     -
     - Whether or not the client should retry a read operation if the operation fails.

   * - **serverSelectionTimeoutMS**
     - 30 seconds
     - The amount of time the ``Client`` should attempt to select a server for an operation before timing outs

   * - **ssl**: an alias of the `tls` optio**
     -
     -

   * - **tls**
     - ``None``
     - The TLS configuration for the ``Client`` to use in its connections with the server.
       By default, TLS is disabled.

   * - **tlsInsecure**
     -
     - : relaxes the TLS constraints on connections being made;
       currently is just an alias of tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`,
       but more behavior may be added to this option in the futur**

   * - **tlsAllowInvalidCertificates**
     - `true`
     - Whether or not the Client should return an error if the server presents an invalid certificate.
       This setting should *not* be set to true in production.
       It should only be used for testing.

   * - **tlsCAFile**
     - 
     - The path to the CA file that the Client should use for TLS.
       If none is specified, then the driver will use the Mozilla root certificates from the ``webpki-roots`` crate.

   * - **tlsCertificateKeyFile**
     -
     - The path to the certificate file that the Client should present to the server to verify its identify.
       If none is specified, then the Client will not attempt to verify its identity to the server.

   * - **w**
     -
     - Requests acknowledgement that the operation has propagated to a specific number or variety of servers.

   * - **wTimeoutMS**
     -
     - Specifies a time limit for the write concern. If an operation has not propagated to the requested level within the time limit, an error will return.

       Note that an error being returned due to a write concern error does not imply that the write would not have finished propagating if allowed more time to finish, and the server will not roll back the writes that occurred before the timeout was reached.

..    * - **zlibCompressionLevel**
..      -
..      - maps to the `level` field of the `Compressor::Zlib` variant (which requires the `zlib-compression` feature flag) of the [`Compressor`] enum

documentation <{+api+}/options/struct.ClientOptions.html>`__.
