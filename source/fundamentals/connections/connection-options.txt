Connection Options
------------------

This section explains several common MongoDB connection and authentication
options. You can pass the connection options as parameters of the connection
URI to specify the behavior of the client.

   * - Option Name
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description

   * - **timeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds that a single operation run on the
       ``Client`` can take before returning a timeout error. Operations honor
       this setting only if there is no deadline on the operation Context.

   * - **connectTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``30000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait before timeout on a TCP
       connection.

   * - **maxPoolSize**
     - integer
     - ``100``
     - Specifies the maximum number of connections that a connection pool may
       have at a given time.

   * - **replicaSet**
     - string
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the replica set name for the cluster. All nodes in the
       replica set must have the same replica set name, or the Client will not
       consider them as part of the set.

   * - **maxIdleTimeMS**
     - integer
     - ``0``
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time a connection can remain idle
       in the connection pool before being removed and closed. The
       default is ``0``, meaning a connection can remain unused
       indefinitely.

   * - **minPoolSize**
     - integer
     - ``0``
     - Specifies the minimum number of connections that the driver maintains
       in a single connection pool.

   * - **socketTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``0``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a socket read or
       write to return before returning a network error. The ``0``
       default value indicates that there is no timeout.

   * - **serverSelectionTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``30000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait to find an available,
       suitable server to execute an operation.

   * - **heartbeatFrequencyMS**
     - integer
     - ``10000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait between periodic
       background server checks.

   * - **tls**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
       connection with the instance. This is automatically set to ``true``
       when using a DNS seedlist (SRV) in the connection string. You can
       override this behavior by setting the value to ``false``.

   * - **w**
     - string or integer
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the write concern. To learn more about values, see the
       server documentation on
       :manual:`Write Concern options </reference/write-concern>`.

   * - **directConnection**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to force dispatch **all** operations to the host
       specified in the connection URI.

For a full list of connection options, see the `ClientOptions API
documentation
<{+api+}/mongo/options#ClientOptions>`__.

.. _rust-timeout-setting:

Single Timeout Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set a single ``Timeout`` option on your ``Client`` to govern the
amount of time that a single operation can take to execute using the
``SetTimeout()`` method or specifying the ``timeoutMS`` option in your
connection URI string. ``Database``, ``Collection``,
``Session``, ``ChangeStream``, and ``Bucket`` instances elsewhere in
your code inherit the ``Timeout`` option from ``Client`` if you do not set a
Context for operations against the same entity. 

If you pass a Context into an operation with a deadline, the driver uses
that Context deadline for the operation. If the context does not have a
deadline, the driver derives a new Context from the given Context using
the ``Timeout`` option set on the ``Client``.

.. note:: Retries under Timeout Specification

   With default settings, if you set a ``Timeout`` option on your ``Client``
   and your operation requires a retry, the driver retries the operation
   as many times as possible before the timeout expires. Once the timeout
   expires, the driver returns a timeout error. Versions 1.1 and later
   of the {+driver-short+} enable retryable reads and writes by default.
   See the Server manual for more information about :ref:`retryable
   reads <retryable-reads>` and :manual:`retryable writes </core/retryable-writes/>`.

The following code shows how to set the ``Timeout`` option on a ``Client``
with the ``SetTimeout`` option:

.. code-block:: go

   opts := options.Client().SetTimeout(5 * time.Second)

The following example shows how you can set a single timeout with the
URI option and execute an operation that inherits this setting:

.. code-block:: go

   uri := "mongodb://user:pass@sample.host:27017/?timeoutMS=5000"
   client := mongo.Connect(uri)
   coll := client.Database("<db>").Collection("<collection>")
   ...
   coll.InsertOne(context.Background(), doc)

.. important:: Legacy Timeout Options

   ``SocketTimeout``, ``wTimeout``, ``MaxTime``, and ``MaxCommitTime``
   will be deprecated in an upcoming release. The driver ignores ``MaxTime`` and
   ``MaxCommitTime`` if you set ``Timeout``. The driver still honors
   ``SocketTimeout`` and ``wTimeout``, but these settings may result in
   undefined behavior. Consider using only the single timeout option instead.
