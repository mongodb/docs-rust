Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **collations** to adjust how your query
or aggregation operation compares string values and returns results. A collation
is a set of character ordering conventions that apply to a specific language and
locale.

Collations in MongoDB
---------------------

MongoDB sorts strings using *binary collation* by default. This collation
method uses the `ASCII standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>`_
character values to compare and order strings. Certain languages and locales
have specific character ordering conventions that differ from the ASCII
standard.

For example, in Canadian French, the right-most accented character determines
the ordering for strings when the other characters are the same. Consider the
following Canadian French words: 

- cote
- coté
- côte
- côté

When using the default binary collation, MongoDB sorts them in the following order:

.. code-block:: none

   cote
   coté
   côte
   côté

When using the Canadian French collation, MongoDB sorts them in the following order:

.. code-block:: none

   cote
   côte
   coté
   côté

Specify a Collation
-------------------

You can define a collation by specifying your collation locale and related options
in a ``Collation`` instance. To build the ``Collation`` instance, call the
``Collation::builder()`` method.

.. note:: Instantiating Options
   
   The {+driver-short+} implements the Builder design pattern for the
   creation of many different types, including ``Collation``. You can
   use the ``builder()`` method to construct an instance of each type
   by chaining option builder functions one at a time.

Call the following ``Collation::builder()`` functions to specify the collation:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1 2
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Possible Values 
     - Description

   * - ``locale()``
     - For a full list of supported locales, see :manual:`Supported Languages and Locales
       </reference/collation-locales-defaults/#supported-languages-and-locales>` in the Server manual.
     - Specifies the ICU locale.
       
   * - ``strength()``
     - ``CollationStrength::Primary``, ``CollationStrength::Secondary``, ``CollationStrength::Tertiary``,
       ``CollationStrength::Quaternary``, and ``CollationStrength::Identical``
     - Specifies the level of comparison to perform

   * - ``case_level()``
     - ``true`` or ``false``
     - Specifies whether the driver performs case comparison

   * - ``case_first()``
     - ``CollationCaseFirst::Upper``, ``CollationCaseFirst::Lower``, and ``CollationCaseFirst::Off``
     - Specifies the sort order of case differences during tertiary level comparisons

   * - ``numeric_ordering()``
     - ``true`` or ``false``
     - Specifies whether the driver compares numeric strings as numbers

   * - ``alternate()``
     - ``CollationAlternate::NonIgnorable`` and ``CollationAlternate::Shifted``
     - Specifies whether the driver considers whitespace and punctuation as base characters
       during string comparison

   * - ``max_variable()``
     - ``CollationMaxVariable::Punct`` and ``CollationMaxVariable::Space``
     - Specifies which characters the driver ignores when ``alternate`` is set to
       ``CollationAlternate::Shifted``

   * - ``normalization()``
     - ``true`` or ``false``
     - Specifies whether the driver performs text normalization for string values

   * - ``backwards()``
     - ``true`` or ``false``
     - Specifies whether the driver sorts strings containing diacritics in reverse character order

Build a Collation Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example specifies a ``Collation`` instance and sets the collation locale
to ``"en_US"``. You must use the ``locale()`` function to build the ``Collation`` instance,
but all other builder functions are optional.

.. code-block:: rust

   let collation = Collation::builder()
        .locale("en_US")
        .build();

Set a Collation on a Collection
-------------------------------

When you create a new collection, you can define the default collation for future
operations called on that collection. Set the default collation by using the ``collation()``
function to build a ``CreateCollectionOptions`` instance. Then, call the ``create_collection()``
method with your options instance as an argument.

.. _rust-create-collection:

Create a Collection Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a collection called ``books`` and specifies a default
collation according to the ``"fr"`` locale conventions. The ``strength()`` collation
builder function receives a value of ``CollationStrength::Primary`` to ignore differences
in diacritics.

.. code-block:: rust

    let collation = Collation::builder()
        .locale("fr")
        .strength(CollationStrength::Primary)
        .build();

    let opts = CreateCollectionOptions::builder()
        .collation(collation)
        .build();
    
    let result = my_db.create_collection("books", opts);

Use the Default Collation Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run an operation that uses a collation on the ``books`` collection, the operation
uses the default collation specified in the :ref:`rust-create-collection`.

Assume the ``books`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   {"name" : "Emma", "length" : "474"}
   {"name" : "Les Misérables", "length": "1462"}
   {"name" : "Infinite Jest", "length" : "1104"}
   {"name" : "Cryptonomicon", "length" : "918"}
   {"name" : "Ça", "length" : "1138"}

.. note::

   To learn how to insert documents into a collection, see :ref:`rust-insert-guide`.
   
The following example uses the ``find()`` method to return all documents in which the value
of the ``name`` field alphabetically precedes ``"Infinite Jest"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: rust

      let query = doc! { "name": doc! { "$lt": "Infinite Jest" } };
      let mut cursor = my_coll.find(query, None).await?;
      
      while let Some(doc) = cursor.try_next().await? {
         println!("{:?}", doc);
      }

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      { "name": "Ça", "length": 1138 }
      { "name": "Cryptonomicon", "length": 918}
      { "name": "Emma", "length": 474 }

If you don't specify a default collation for the ``books`` collection, the ``find()`` method
follows default binary collation rules to determine the ``name`` values that precede
``"Infinite Jest"``. These rules place words beginning with "Ç" after those beginning with "I".
If the preceding find operation follows binary collation rules, the code returns only the following
documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "name": "Cryptonomicon", "length": 918}
   { "name": "Emma", "length": 474 }

.. _rust-index-collation:

Set a Collation on an Index 
---------------------------

When you create a new index on a collection, you can define the default collation for
operations that use the index. To run an operation that uses the index and its default collation,
your operation and index must specify the same collation. Additionally, ensure that the index
specifying the collation covers the query. 

.. note::

   To learn more about indexes and covered queries, see the :ref:`rust-indexes` guide.

Set the index collation by using the ``collation()`` function to build an ``IndexOptions`` instance.
Then, pass your ``IndexOptions`` as an argument to an ``IndexModel`` instance, and pass your
``IndexModel`` as an argument to the ``create_index()`` method.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``create_index()`` method to create an ascending index on the
``name`` field and specifies a new collation with an ``"en_US"`` locale:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      let collation = Collation::builder()
         .locale("en_US")
         .build();

      let index_opts = IndexOptions::builder()
         .collation(collation)
         .build();
      
      let index = IndexModel::builder()
         .keys(doc! { "name": 1 })
         .options(index_opts)
         .build();
      
      let res = my_coll.create_index(index, None)?;

      println!("Created index: {}", res.index_name);

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

       Created index: name_1

.. _rust-op-collation:

Set a Collation on an Operation
-------------------------------

Operations that read, update, and delete documents from a collection can use collations.
Applying a collation to an operation overrides any default collation previously defined
for a collection.

If you apply a new collation to an operation that differs from an index's collation,
you cannot use that index. As a result, the operation may not perform as well as one
that is covered by an index. For more information on the disadvantages of sorting operations
not covered by an index, see :manual:`Using Indexes to Sort Query Results </tutorial/sort-results-with-indexes/>`
in the Server manual.

Example
~~~~~~~

You can use operations that support collation to update and query for documents in the 
``books`` collection. 

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to return documents in which the value of
the ``length`` field is greater than ``"1000"``. The ``numeric_ordering()`` collation builder
function receives a value of ``true``, which ensures that values are sorted in numerical order
rather than alphabetical order:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      let collation = Collation::builder()
         .locale("en_US")
         .numeric_ordering(true)
         .build();

      let opts = FindOptions::builder()
         .collation(collation)
         .build();
      
      let filter = doc! { "length": doc! { "$gt": "1000" } };
      let mut cursor = my_coll.find(filter, opts)?;

      for result in cursor {
         println!("{}", result?);
      }

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      {"name" : "Infinite Jest", "length" : "1104"}
      {"name" : "Ça", "length" : "1138"}
      {"name" : "Les Misérables", "length": "1462"}
   
If you run the preceding find operation without setting the ``numeric_ordering`` option to ``true``,
the driver compares ``length`` values as strings. Then, the code returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "name": "Cryptonomicon", "length": 918}
   { "name": "Emma", "length": 474 }
