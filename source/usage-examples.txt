Overview
--------

Usage examples enable you gain a broad understanding of common MongoDB operations
by demonstrating how to organize and run a small sample application. Each usage
example includes the following:

- A general overview of the MongoDB operation
- Asynchronous and synchronous Rust code examples that you can run in
  your own environment
- The expected output of the code example

.. TODO: To learn more about the runtimes offered by the {+driver-short+},
   see <add link to runtimes page>.

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

The usage examples run operations on the ``restaurants`` collection in the
``sample_restaurants`` database. This dataset is one of the sample datasets
provided in the Atlas sample data. Before running the programs included in
the usage examples, perform the following actions:

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Load the Sample Datasets
      
      Follow the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide </getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`
      to import the sample datasets into your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas.

   .. step:: Add the Usage Example Code to Your Development Environment

      Copy the usage example program that you wish to run. Then, navigate to a file in
      your application and paste the program.
      
      To learn more about creating an application that uses the {+driver-short+}, follow the
      :ref:`rust-quickstart`.

   .. step:: Replace the Connection String Placeholder

      In your application file, replace the connection string placeholder so that the program
      connects to your MongoDB deployment:

      .. code-block:: rust
         :copyable: false

         let uri = "<connection string>";

After completing these steps, you can run a program in your development environment
and see the output described in the **Expected Output** section of the corresponding
usage example.
