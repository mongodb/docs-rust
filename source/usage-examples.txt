Overview
--------

Usage examples enable you to set up, run, and gain a broad understanding of
a MongoDB operation. Each usage example includes the following:

- A general overview of the MongoDB operation
- One asynchronous and one synchronous Rust program that you can run
  in your own environment
- The expected output of the program

.. TODO: To learn more about the runtimes offered by the {+driver-short+},
   see <add link to runtimes page>.

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

The usage examples run operations on the ``restaurants`` collection in the
``sample_restaurants`` database. This dataset is one of the :atlas:`sample datasets
</sample-data>` provided by Atlas. Before running the programs included in the
usage examples, perform the following actions to access the sample datasets in
your development environment.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Retrieve the Sample Datasets
      
      Follow the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide </getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`
      to import the sample datasets into your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas.

   .. step:: Use the Sample Datasets in your Development Environment

      Copy the usage example program that you wish to run. Then, navigate to a file in
      your application and paste the program.
      
      To learn more about creating an application that uses the {+driver-short+}, follow the
      :ref:`rust-quickstart`.

   .. step:: Edit the Connection String

      Edit the connection URI in your application file to connect to your MongoDB instance:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         // Replace the placeholder with your MongoDB deployment's connection string
         let uri = "<connection string>";

After completing these steps, you should be able to run a program in your 
development environment and see the output described on the program's corresponding
usage example page.
