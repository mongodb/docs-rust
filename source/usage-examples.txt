Overview
--------

Usage examples provide convenient starting points for popular MongoDB
operations. Each example provides the following:

- A full asynchronous and synchronous Rust program that you can run in
  your own environment
- The expected output of the program

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

These examples use the :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data>` provided by
Atlas. Each example runs one or more operations on the ``restaurants``
collection in the ``sample_restaurants`` database. You can load the sample
datasets into your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas by following the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide </getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`
or you can :guides:`import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance
</server/import/>`.

Once you import the datasets, you can copy and paste a usage example into your
development environment of choice. Follow the :ref:`rust-quickstart` to learn
more about getting started with the {+driver-short+}.

Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have copied a usage example into your development environment, you
must edit the connection URI to connect the example to your MongoDB instance:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   // Replace the bracketed text with your MongoDB deployment's connection string
   let uri = "<connection string>";
