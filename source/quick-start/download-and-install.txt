   .. step:: Install Rust and Cargo

      Ensure you have Rust {+min-rust-version+} or later, and Cargo, the
      Rust package manager, installed in your development environment.

      For information on how to install Rust and Cargo see
      `downloading and installing Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`__.

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``rust_quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cargo new rust_quickstart
      
      When this command successfully completes, you should have a ``Cargo.toml`` 
      file and a ``src`` directory with a ``main.rs`` file in your
      ``rust_quickstart`` directory.

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd rust_quickstart

      Run the following command to navigate into the source 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd src

   .. step:: Install the Rust Driver

      Run the following command in your shell to install
      the driver in your project directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cargo add mongodb@{+version+}

      This command performs the following actions:

      - Downloads the ``mongodb`` package and the dependencies it requires
      - Saves the package in the ``.cargo`` directory
      - Records the dependency information in the ``Cargo.toml`` file

After you complete these steps, you should have Rust and Cargo installed 
and a new project directory with the driver dependencies installed.
