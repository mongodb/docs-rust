   .. step:: Install Rust and Cargo

      Ensure you have Rust {+min-rust-version+} or later, and Cargo, the
      Rust package manager, installed in your development environment.

      For information on how to install Rust and Cargo, see
      the official Rust guide on `downloading and installing Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`__.

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``rust_quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cargo new rust_quickstart
      
      When this command successfully completes, you should have a ``Cargo.toml`` 
      file and a ``src`` directory with a ``main.rs`` file in your
      ``rust_quickstart`` directory.

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd rust_quickstart

   .. step:: Install the Rust Driver

      Add the following crates to your project by including them in the
      dependencies list located in your project's ``Cargo.toml`` file:
      
      - ``mongodb``, the {+driver-short+} crate
      - ``serde_json``, a JSON data representation crate
      - ``futures``, an asynchronous runtime crate that provides core abstractions

      .. tip::
   
         The ``mongodb`` crate automatically resolves the ``bson`` crate, or the
         main MongoDB data representation crate. You can omit the ``bson`` crate from
         your dependencies list and add the ``use mongodb::bson`` import statement to
         your project files.

      The following code shows an example dependencies list that
      includes the preceding crates:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Asynchronous API
            :tabid: asynchronous-api

            .. code-block:: bash

               [dependencies]
               serde_json = "1.0.107"
               futures = "0.3.28"
               tokio = {version = "1.32.0", features = ["full"]}
               
               [dependencies.mongodb]
               version = "{+version+}"
               features = ["tokio-runtime"]
         
         .. tab:: Synchronous API
            :tabid: synchronous-api

            .. code-block:: bash
               
               [dependencies]
               serde_json = "1.0.107"

               [dependencies.mongodb]
               version = "{+version+}"
               features = ["tokio-sync"]

      
      If you need to use a different synchronous or asynchronous runtime crate,
      replace the feature flag with your runtime crate's corresponding flag.
      The driver supports the following alternative runtime crates:

      - the ``async-std`` crate with the ``"async-std-runtime"`` feature flag
      - the ``sync`` crate with the ``"sync"`` feature flag

      .. tip::

         The ``tokio`` asynchronous runtime is the driver's default runtime crate.
         You do not need to include the ``"tokio-runtime"`` feature flag in your
         dependencies list to use this crate.

      If you need to use both the asynchronous and synchronous runtimes, add the
      following dependencies list to your ``Cargo.toml`` file:

      .. code-block:: bash
         
         [dependencies]
         serde_json = "1.0.107"
         futures = "0.3.28"
         tokio = {version = "1.32.0", features = ["full"]}

         [dependencies.mongodb]
         version = "2.6.1"
         features = ["tokio-sync"]

After you complete these steps, you should have Rust and Cargo installed 
and a new Rust project with the necessary driver dependencies.
