   .. step:: Install Rust and Cargo

      Ensure you have Rust {+min-rust-version+} or later, and Cargo, the
      Rust package manager, installed in your development environment.

      For information on how to install Rust and Cargo, see
      the official Rust guide on `downloading and installing Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`__.

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``rust_quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cargo new rust_quickstart
      
      When this command successfully completes, you should have a ``Cargo.toml`` 
      file and a ``src`` directory with a ``main.rs`` file in your
      ``rust_quickstart`` directory.

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd rust_quickstart

   .. step:: Install the Rust Driver

      Add the following crates to your project by including them in the 
      dependencies list located in your project's ``Cargo.toml`` file:
      
      - ``mongodb``, the {+driver-short+} crate
      - ``bson``, the MongoDB data representation crate
      - ``serde_json``, A JSON data representation crate
      
      The following code shows an example dependencies list that
      includes the preceding crates:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Asynchronous API
            :tabid: asynchronous-api

            .. code-block:: bash

               [dependencies]
               bson = "2.6.1"
               serde_json = "1.0.104"
               
               [dependencies.mongodb]
               version = "{+version+}"
               default-features = false
               features = ["async-std-runtime"]
         
         .. tab:: Synchronous API
            :tabid: synchronous-api

            .. code-block:: bash
               
               [dependencies]
               bson = "2.6.1"
               serde_json = "1.0.104"

               [dependencies.mongodb]
               version = "{+version+}"
               features = ["tokio-sync"]

After you complete these steps, you should have Rust and Cargo installed 
and a new Rust project with the necessary driver dependencies.
