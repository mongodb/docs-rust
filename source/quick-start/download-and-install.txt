   .. step:: Install Rust and Cargo

      Ensure you have Rust {+min-rust-version+} or later, and Cargo, the
      Rust package manager, installed in your development environment.

      For information on how to install Rust and Cargo, see
      the official Rust guide on `downloading and installing Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`__.

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``rust_quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cargo new rust_quickstart
      
      When this command successfully completes, you should have a ``Cargo.toml`` 
      file and a ``src`` directory with a ``main.rs`` file in your
      ``rust_quickstart`` directory.

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd rust_quickstart

   .. step:: Install the Rust Driver

      Open the ``cargo.toml`` file in vim or the IDE of your choice and
      under the ``[dependencies]`` line, write the following:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongodb = "{+version+}"
         bson = "2.6.1"

      if you're planning on using the ``asynchronous`` API, add the
      following line to your ``cargo.toml`` file:

      .. code-block:: bash

         tokio = "1.29.1"

      This step performs the following action:

      - Records the dependency information in the ``Cargo.toml`` file

After you complete these steps, you should have Rust and Cargo installed 
and a new project directory with the driver dependencies recorded.
