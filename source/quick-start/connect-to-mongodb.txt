==================
Connect to MongoDB

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your Rust Application

      Open the file called ``main.rs`` in your
      ``rust_quickstart/src`` project directory.  In this file, you can
      begin writing your application.
      
      Copy and paste the following code into the ``main.rs`` file:
      
      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Asynchronous API
            :tabid: asynchronous-api

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/code-snippets/connect-async.rs
               :language: rust
         
         .. tab:: Synchronous API
            :tabid: synchronous-api

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/code-snippets/connect-sync.rs
               :language: rust

   .. step:: Assign the Connection String

      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`rust-quick-start-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Rust Application

      In your shell, run the following command to compile and run this application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         cargo run

      You should see the details of the retrieved movie document in the 
      command line output:

      .. code-block:: none

         {
            "_id": { ... },
            "plot": "Young Pauline is left a lot of money when her wealthy ...";
            "genres": [
               "Action"
            ],
            "runtime": 199,
            "cast": [
               "Pearl White",
               "Crane Wilbur",
               "Paul Panzer",
               "Edward Jos√®"
            ],
            ...
         }
         
      If you encounter an error or see no output, check whether you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``main.rs`` file, and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you should have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
