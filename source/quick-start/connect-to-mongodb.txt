==================
Connect to MongoDB

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your Node.js Application

      Create a file to contain your application called ``index.rs`` in your
      ``rust_quickstart/src`` project directory. 
      
      Copy and paste the following code into the ``index.rs`` file:
      
      .. tabs::
         .. tab:: Synchronous API
            :tabid: synchronous-api

            .. code-block:: rust
               


 

   .. step:: Assign the Connection String

      Replace the ``<connection string uri>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`node-quick-start-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Node.js Application

      In your shell, run the following command to start this application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         node index.js

      You should see the details of the retrieved movie document in the 
      command line output:

      .. code-block:: none

         {
           _id: ...,
           plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
           genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
           ...
           title: 'Back to the Future',
           ...
         }

      If you encounter an error or see no output, check whether you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``index.js`` file, and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you should have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
